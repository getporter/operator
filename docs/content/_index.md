With Porter Operator, you define installations, credential sets and parameter sets in custom resources on a cluster, and the operator handles executing Porter when the desired state of an installation changes.
Learn more about how Porter manages desired state in our [Desired State QuickStart].

![architectural diagram showing that an installation resource triggers the operator to run a porter agent job, which then runs the bundle, saving state in mongodb](operator.png)

The initial prototype gave us a lot of feedback for how to improve Porter's support for desired state, resulting in the new [porter installation apply] command.
We are currently rewriting the operator to make use of this new command and desired state patterns.

You can watch the https://github.com/getporter/operator repository to know when new releases are ready, and participate in design discussions.

## Current State

The operator is still under active development, but it is ready for you to try out and provide feedback!
We don't get have custom resources for Credential and Parameter sets, so you will need to [use the Porter cli to define those before using the operator][connect].
