In this QuickStart you will learn how to install and use the [Porter Operator] on a non-production cluster.

[Porter Operator]: /operator/

## Prerequisites

* [Install the most recent Porter v1 prerelease][install-porter]
* Docker, either a local installation or a remote Docker Host.
* A Kubernetes cluster. [KinD] or [Minikube] work well but follow the links for required configuration.
* kubectl, with its kubeconfig configured to use the cluster.

## Install the Operator

The Porter Operator is installed using Porter, and requires an existing Kubernetes cluster.
First, generate a credential set that points to the location of your kubeconfig file, for example using the path $HOME/.kube/config.

The commands below use the v0.6.0 release, but there may be a more recent release of the Operator.
Check our [releases page](https://github.com/getporter/operator/releases) and use the most recent version number.

```
porter credentials generate porterops -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:v0.6.0
```

Now that Porter knows which cluster to target, install the Operator with the following command:

```
porter install porterops -c porterops -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:v0.6.0
```

Before you use the operator, you need to configure a Kubernetes namespace with the necessary configuration.
The bundle includes a custom action that prepares a namespace for you:

```
porter invoke porterops --action configureNamespace --param namespace=quickstart -c porterops
```

The Porter Operator is now installed on your cluster in the porter-operator-system namespace, along with a Mongodb server.
This database is not secured with a username/password, so do not use this default installation configuration with production secrets!
The cluster has a namespace, quickstart, where we will create resources and Porter will create jobs to run Porter.

## Point porter at the operator's datastore

Let's update your local porter CLI to read the data from the operator's datastore.
This isn't necessary for the operator to work, but will allow us to see what's happening and understand how the operator works.

Run the following command to expose the operator's mongodb server to your localhost:
```
kubectl port-forward --namespace porter-operator-system svc/mongodb 27020:27017 >/dev/null &
```

Update your porter configuration file at ~/.porter/config.toml to use the in-cluster mongodb server.
Create the file if it does not exist.

```toml
namespace = "quickstart"
default-storage = "in-cluster-mongodb"

[[storage]]
  name = "in-cluster-mongodb"
  plugin = "mongodb"

  [storage.config]
    url = "mongodb://localhost:27020"
```

Run `porter list` to verify that your configuration is working.
The output should print an empty list of installations.

```
$ porter list
NAMESPACE   NAME   CREATED   MODIFIED   LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
```

## Install a Bundle

For this QuickStart, we will use the [getporter/hello-llama] bundle. It does not allocate any resources or require credentials, and is a demo bundle that prints the specified name to the console.

The Operator uses the concept of **desired state**.
It watches for installation.porter.sh resources (which will be referred to as just installation in this Quickstart) on the cluster, and compares the desired state of the installation from that resource with Porter's records. If the installation does not already exist, the bundle is installed. If it already exists, and the desired state doesn't match Porter's records, the installation is upgraded. When the installation resource is deleted, the installation is uninstalled.

Let's create an installation resource that specifies that we want to have the getporter/hello-llama bundle installed.

1. Create a file named [llama.yaml](llama.yaml) with the following contents:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
    kind: Installation
    metadata:
      name: hello-llama
      namespace: quickstart
    spec:
      schemaVersion: 1.0.2
      namespace: quickstart
      name: mellama
      bundle:
        repository: getporter/hello-llama
        version: 0.1.1
      parameters:
        name: quickstart
    ```
1. Apply the installation resource to the cluster
   ```
   kubectl apply -f llama.yaml
   ```
1. The operator detects the installation and runs the Porter Agent (a job that runs the porter CLI). The agent will run the appropriate porter install command to install the bundle. The bundle runs in a separate job (known as the installer). You can watch the progress of these events with kubectl with `kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch`.
   ```console
   $ kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch
   NAME                          READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-llama-7245-hhcq4        1/1     Running             0          7s
   install-mellama-g769d-nzqsn   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
   install-mellama-g769d-nzqsn   0/1     Completed           0          5s
   hello-llama-7245-hhcq4        0/1     Completed           0          13s
   ```
   
   You can tell that porter is done when the hello-llama-* pod is completed.
1. Use `porter list` to see the status of the installation:
   ```console
   $ porter list
   NAMESPACE    NAME      CREATED          MODIFIED         LAST ACTION   LAST STATUS
   quickstart   mellama   19 seconds ago   19 seconds ago   install       succeeded
   ```
1. You can see the logs from the installation with `porter logs --installation mellama`.
   ```console
   $ porter logs --installation mellama
   Could not stream logs for pod install-mellama-5xjch-tdgts. Retrying...: container "invocation" in pod "install-mellama-5xjch-tdgts" is waiting to start: ContainerCreating
   executing install action from hello-llama (installation: mellama)
   Hello, quickstart
   execution completed successfully!
   ```

## Upgrade an installation

Now that our bundle is installed, let's make some changes to trigger an upgrade.

1. Edit llama.yaml and change the name parameter to a different value:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
    kind: Installation
    metadata:
      name: hello-llama
      namespace: quickstart
    spec:
      schemaVersion: 1.0.2
      namespace: quickstart
      name: mellama
      bundle:
        repository: getporter/hello-llama
        version: 0.1.1
      parameters:
        name: Grogu
    ```
1. Apply the updated installation resource:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f llama.yaml
   ```
1. The operator will detect that the parameter has changed, and run porter upgrade.
   Again, use `kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch` to wait for Porter Agent to finish executing the upgrade-mellama-* job.
   ```console
   $ kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch
   NAME                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
   hello-llama-7245-hhcq4        0/1     Completed   0          18m
   hello-llama-9550-sms74        0/1     Completed   0          3m12s
   install-mellama-g769d-nzqsn   0/1     Completed   0          17m
   upgrade-mellama-2d6rg-4kc9z   0/1     Completed   0          3m2s
   ```
1. Let's run `porter show mellama` to see more details about the installation.
   Note that the installation is using the updated value "Grogu" for the name parameter.
   ```console
   $ porter show mellama
   Name: mellama
   Namespace: quickstart
   Created: 12 minutes ago
   Modified: 6 seconds ago

   Bundle:
     Repository: getporter/hello-llama
     Version: 0.1.1

   Parameters:
   -----------------------
   Name  Type    Value
   -----------------------
   name  string  Grogu

   Status:
     Reference: getporter/hello-llama:v0.1.1
     Version: 0.1.1
     Last Action: upgrade
     Status: succeeded
     Digest: sha256:22cdfad0756c9ce1a8f4694b0411440dfab99fa2e07125ff78efe555dd63d73e
   ```

## Retry the last operation

If your bundle operation failed, you can run it again by changing the `porter.sh/retry` annotation on the installation CRD and then re-applying the file with `kubectl apply -f`:

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: porter-hello
  annotations:
    porter.sh/retry: "2022-01-01 12:00:00"
```

Each time you need to repeat the operation without changing the spec, change the annotation value to a different value.
A good strategy is to set the retry annotation to the current timestamp to generate a unique value.

## Uninstall a bundle

There are two methods for uninstalling a bundle:
1. Delete the installation resource with `kubectl delete installation NAME`.
2. Set uninstalled=true on the installation spec.

Setting a flag on the installation is useful when you want to preserve a record of the installation in Kubernetes.
With either method, a record is preserved in Porter's database.
Let's walk through the second method in detail.

1. Edit llama.yaml and add `uninstalled: true` under the spec:
   ```yaml
    apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
    kind: Installation
    metadata:
      name: hello-llama
      namespace: quickstart
    spec:
      uninstalled: true
      schemaVersion: 1.0.2
      namespace: quickstart
      name: mellama
      # Contents truncated because they aren't relevant to uninstall
    ```
1. Apply the updated installation resource:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f llama.yaml
   ```
1. The operator will detect that the parameter has changed, and run porter upgrade.
    Again, use `kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch` to wait for Porter Agent to finish executing the uninstall-mellama-* job.
    ```console
    $ kubectl get pods -n quickstart --watch
    NAME                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    hello-llama-7245-hhcq4         0/1     Completed   0          18m
    hello-llama-9550-sms74         0/1     Completed   0          3m12s
    hello-llama-29rxx-257sm        0/1     Completed   0          1m20s
    install-mellama-g769d-nzqsn    0/1     Completed   0          17m
    upgrade-mellama-2d6rg-4kc9z    0/1     Completed   0          3m2s
    uninstall-mellama-31866-jxclw  0/1     Completed   0          43s
    ```
1. Let's run `porter show mellama` to see more details about the installation. Note that the last action in the status section is "uninstall".
    ```console
    $ porter show mellama
    Name: mellama
    Namespace: quickstart
    Created: 16 minutes ago
    Modified: 10 seconds ago

    Bundle:
     Repository: getporter/hello-llama
     Version: 0.1.1

    Parameters:
    -----------------------
    Name  Type    Value
    -----------------------
    name  string  Grogu

    Status:
     Reference: getporter/hello-llama:v0.1.1
     Version: 0.1.1
     Last Action: uninstall
     Status: succeeded
     Digest: sha256:22cdfad0756c9ce1a8f4694b0411440dfab99fa2e07125ff78efe555dd63d73e
    ```
