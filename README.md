# Porter Operator

üö® **This is a new project; the goals below are aspirational and not all implemented yet.**

The Porter Operator gives you a native, integrated experience for managing your
bundles from Kubernetes. It is the recommended way to automate your bundle
pipeline with support for GitOps.

* Manage bundle installations using desired state configuration.
  * Installs the bundle when an installation CRD is added. 
  * Upgrades the bundle when the bundle definition or values used to install the bundle change.
  * Uninstalls the bundle when the installation CRD is deleted.
* Automatically deploy new versions of bundles when a new version is pushed, and update an 
  installation when changes are pushed in git, through integration with Flux.
* Isolated environments for running bundles in your organization, limiting
  access to secrets used by the bundles using namespaces and RBAC.
* Create and respond to events on your cluster to integrate bundles into your
  pipeline.

# Project Status

üöß This is a proof of concept only, is currently being rewritten to work with the Porter v1 prerelease.
**It is not safe to use in production or with production secrets.**

We are planning a security review and audit before it is released.

# Try it out

Follow our [Installation Guide][install] to install the Porter Operator on an existing Kubernetes cluster.
If you want to build from source, instructions are in the [Contributor's Guide].

# Configure

The bundle accepts a parameter, porteConfig, that should be a YAML-formatted [Porter configuration file](https://release-v1.porter.sh/configuration).

Here is an example of the default configuration used when none is specified:

```yaml
# Resolve secrets using secrets on the cluster in the current namespace.
defaultSecretsPlugin: "kubernetes.secrets"

# Use the mongodb server that was deployed with the operator
defaultStorage: "in-cluster-mongodb"
storage:
  - name: "in-cluster-mongodb"
    plugin: "mongodb"
    config:
      url: "mongodb://mongodb.porter-operator-system.svc.cluster.local"
```

You can use a different file when installing the operator like so:

```
porter install porterops --param porterConfig=./myconfig.yaml  \
  -c porterops -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:canary
```

The bundle also has parameters defined that control how the Porter agent is configured and run.

| Parameter  | Description  |
|---|---|
| namespace  | Setup Porter in this namespace  |
| porterRepository  | Docker image repository of the Porter agent.<br/><br/>Defaults to ghcr.io/getporter/porter.  |
| porterVersion  | Version of the Porter agent, e.g. latest, canary, v0.33.0.<br/><br/>Defaults to latest.  |
| pullPolicy  | Specifies how the Porter agent image should be pulled. Does not affect how bundles are pulled.<br/><br/>Defaults to PullAlways for latest and canary, and PullIfNotPresent otherwise.  |
| serviceAccount  | Name of the service account to run the Porter agent.<br/>If set, you are responsible for creating this service account and binding it to the porter-agent ClusterRole.<br/><br/>Defaults to the porter-agent account created by the configureNamespace custom action.  |
| installationServiceAccount  | Name of the service account to run installation with.<br/>If set, you are responsible for creating this service account and giving it required permissions.  |
| volumeSize  | Size of the volume shared between Porter and the bundles it executes.<br/><br/>Defaults to 64Mi.  |


# Uninstall a bundle

This isn't supported yet. Once it's implemented, uninstall is triggered when a CRD is deleted.

# Retry the last operation

If your bundle operation failed, you can run it again by changing an annotation on the installation CRD:

```
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: porter-hello
  annotations:
    retry: 1
```

Each time you need to repeat the operation, change the annotation value again.
There is nothing special about the key used for the annotation. I chose retry,
however you could use "favorite-color: blue", changing the value each time, and
it would still trigger Porter to retry it. 

# Configure the Operator

This section breaks down what the configureNamespace action of the bundle is
doing under the hood. If you end up having to manually configure these values,
let us know! That means the custom action in our bundle isn't working out.

## AgentConfig

The operator has a CRD, agentconfig.porter.sh, that contains settings for the
porter operator. These values are used by the job that runs porter. Only
serviceAccount is required, the rest may be omitted or set to "". This is generated
for you by the **configureNamespace** custom action of the porter-operator bundle.

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: porter
spec:
  serviceAccount: porter-agent # Required. ServiceAccount to run the Porter Agent under.
  pullPolicy: Always # Optional. Policy for pulling new versions of the Porter Agent image. Defaults to Always for latest and canary, IfNotPresent otherwise.
  porterVersion: canary # Optional. Version of the Porter Agent image. Allowed values: latest, canary, vX.Y.Z
  porterRepository: ghcr.io/getporter/porter-agent # Optional. The Porter Agent repository to use.
  volumeSize: 128Mi # Optional. The size of the shared volume used by Porter and the invocation image. Defaults to 64Mi
  installationServiceAccount: # Optional. ServiceAccount to run the installation under, service account must exist in the namespace that the installation is run in.
```

The agent configuration has a hierarchy and values are merged from all three
(empty values are ignored):

1. Referenced on the Installation (highest)
2. The default AgentConfig in the installation's namespace.
3. The default AgentConfig defined in the porter-operator-system namespace. (lowest)

## PorterConfig

The operator has a CRD, porterconfig.porter.sh, that contains a [Porter configuration file](https://release-v1.porter.sh/configuration)
embedded in the spec. 

üîí We don't yet support referencing an external secret, so be careful if you embed a real connection string in this file!

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: PorterConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  debug: true # Optional. Specifies if porter should output additional debug logs. Defaults to false.
  debugPlugins: true # Optional. Specifies if porter should output additional debug logs related to plugins. Defaults to false.
  defaultSecretsPlugin: kubernetes.secrets. # Optional. Specifies the key of the secrets plugin to use. Defaults to the Kubernetes secrets plugin.
  default-storage: in-cluster-mongodb # Optional. Specifies the name of the storage configuration to use. Defaults to the in-cluster mongodb server deployed with the operator.
  storage: # Optional. Defines a storage configuration to use instead of the in-cluster mongodb server.
    - name: in-cluster-mongodb
      plugin: mongodb
      url: "mongodb://mongodb.porter-operator-system.svc.cluster.local"
```

# Contact

* [Mailing List] - Great for following the project at a high level because it
  is low traffic, mostly release notes and blog posts on new features.
* [Slack] - Discuss #porter or #cnab with other users and the maintainers.
* [Open an Issue] - If you have a bug, feature request or question about Porter,
  ask on GitHub so that we can prioritize it and make sure you get an answer.
  If you ask on Slack, we will probably turn around and make an issue anyway. üòâ

# Looking for Contributors

Want to work on Porter with us? üíñ We are actively seeking out new contributors
with the hopes of building up both casual contributors and enticing some of you
into becoming reviewers and maintainers.

<p align="center">Start with our <a href="https://porter.sh/contribute/">New Contributors Guide</a>

Porter wouldn't be possible without our [contributors][contributors], carrying
the load and making it better every day! üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. üòâ

We use a single [project board][board] across all of our repositories to track
open issues and pull requests.

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
