# PorterOps: Porter Operator

üö® This is a new project; the goals below are aspirational and not all implemented yet.

PorterOps not only gives you a native, integrated experience for managing your
bundles with Kubernetes but is the recommended way to automate your bundle
pipeline with support for GitOps.

* Automate building and publishing bundles, when the bundle definition changes
  or new versions of images used by the bundle are available.
* Automatically deploy new versions of bundles.
* Isolated environments for running bundles in your organization, limiting
  access to secrets used by the bundles using namespaces and RBAC.
* Create and respond to events on your cluster to integrate bundles into your
  pipeline.

# Install

Use explain to see what credentials and parameters you can use when installing and configuring the operator.
```
porter explain -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:canary
```

Generate a credential set for the bundle, the only required credential for the operator is a kubeconfig for the cluster that the operator is to be installed in.
```
porter credentials generate porterops -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:canary
```

Install the operator into the porter-operator-system namespace
```
porter install porterops -c porterops -r ghcr.io/getporter/porter-operator:canary
```

Create a namespace with the appropriate rbac, secrets and configmaps. This is where you will run porter.

```
porter invoke porterops --action configure-namespace --param namespace=TODO -c porterops
```

# Install a bundle

Here is an example installation CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: porter-hello
spec:
  reference: "getporter/porter-hello:v0.1.1"
  action: "install"
```

After you apply it with `kubectl apply -f`, the Porter Operator will run the following command:

```
porter install porter-hello getporter/porter-hello:v0.1.1
```

# Upgrade a bundle

Edit the installation CRD and change the action to "upgrade":

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: porter-hello
spec:
  reference: "getporter/porter-hello:v0.1.1"
  action: "upgrade"
```

# Retry the last operator

If your bundle operation failed, you can run it again by changing an annotation on the installation CRD:

```
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: Installation
metadata:
  name: porter-hello
  annotations:
    retry: 1
spec:
  reference: "getporter/porter-hello:v0.1.1"
  action: "upgrade"
```

Each time you need to repeat the operation, change the annotation value again.
There is nothing special about the key used for the annotation. I chose retry,
however you could use "favorite-color: blue", changing the value each time, and
it would still trigger Porter to retry it. 

# Configure the Operator

This section breaks down what the configure-namespace action of the bundle is
doing under the hood. If you end up having to manually configure these values,
let us know! That means the custom action in our bundle isn't working out.

## Define Secrets

The operator uses secrets defined in the namespace of the CRD being managed to populate
Porter's config file and environment variables. For example the azure connection
string, or service principal environment variables.

### porter-config

These secrets are copied into the pod as files to tell Porter where to save its
data and resolve secrets. This is generated for you by the
**configure-namespace** custom action of the porter-operator bundle.

```
kubectl create secret generic porter-config \
  --from-file=config.toml=/Users/carolynvs/.porter/k8s.config.toml
```

### porter-env

These secrets are copied into the pod as environment variables. Porter will use
them to for the plugins so that they can connect to remote services such storage
or vault. This is generated for you by the **configure-namespace** custom action
of the porter-operator bundle.

```
kubectl create secret generic porter-env \
  --from-literal=AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=$AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING \
  --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
  --from-literal=AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
  --from-literal=AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID
``` 

Right now the bundle only works with the kubernetes and azure plugins, by default it uses the kubernetes plugin which does not need any further configuration, the secrets above are only required if you want to use the [Azure plugin](https://github.com/getporter/kubernetes-plugins) .

## AgentConfig

The operator has a CRD, agentconfig.porter.sh, that contains settings for the
porter operator. These values are used by the job that runs porter. Only
serviceAccount is required, the rest may be omitted or set to "". This is generated
for you by the **configure-namespace** custom action of the porter-operator bundle.

```yaml
apiVersion: porter.sh/v1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: porter
spec:
  serviceAccount: porter-agent # Required. ServiceAccount to run the Porter Agent under.
  pullPolicy: Always # Optional. Policy for pulling new versions of the Porter Agent image. Defaults to Always for latest and canary, IfNotPresent otherwise.
  porterVersion: canary # Optional. Version of the Porter Agent image. Allowed values: latest, canary, vX.Y.Z
  porterRepository: ghcr.io/getporter/porter-agent # Optional. The Porter Agent repository to use.
  volumeSize: 
  installationServiceAccount: # Optional. ServiceAccount to run the installation under, service account must exist in the namespace that the installation is run in.
```

The agent configuration has a hierarchy and values are merged from all three
(empty values are ignored):

1. Defined on the Installation (highest)
2. Defined in the Installation Namespace
3. Defined in the Operator Namespace (lowest)

# Contact

* [Mailing List] - Great for following the project at a high level because it
  is low traffic, mostly release notes and blog posts on new features.
* [Slack] - Discuss #porter or #cnab with other users and the maintainers.
* [Open an Issue] - If you have a bug, feature request or question about Porter,
  ask on GitHub so that we can prioritize it and make sure you get an answer.
  If you ask on Slack, we will probably turn around and make an issue anyway. üòâ

# Looking for Contributors

Want to work on Porter with us? üíñ We are actively seeking out new contributors
with the hopes of building up both casual contributors and enticing some of you
into becoming reviewers and maintainers.

<p align="center">Start with our <a href="https://porter.sh/contribute/">New Contributors Guide</a>

Porter wouldn't be possible without our [contributors][contributors], carrying
the load and making it better every day! üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. üòâ

We use a single [project board][board] across all of our repositories to track
open issues and pull requests.

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
